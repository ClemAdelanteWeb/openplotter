Adding a tool (private Python file)

Openplotter is able to work with external Python scripts

Openplotter can:
- autostart the script
- manual start stop the script from the menu
- and can call the script with cmd argument "settings"

Example
You build your own test.py script.
put the script into the tools directory

Now you edit openplotter.conf at the section [TOOLS]
if there is only 
py = 0
delete the zero and fill in [['Text in the Menu','help description for status line','test.py',0]]
if there is already something change it to
py = [[.....],['Text in the Menu','help description for status line','test.py',0]]

If you want the script to be started automatically change the 0 to 1
finished
